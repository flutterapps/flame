# Collision detection
The collision detection system supports three different types of shapes that you can build hitboxes
from, these shapes are Polygon, Rectangle and Circle. A hitbox can be represented by many shapes to
form the area which can be used to either detect collisions or whether it contains a point or not,
the latter is very useful for accurate gesture detection. The collision detection does not handle
what should happen when two hitboxes collide, so it is up to the user to implement what will happen
when for example two position components have intersecting hitboxes.

## Mixins
### Hitbox
The `Hitbox` mixin is mainly used for two things; to make detection of collisions with other
hitboxes and gestures on top of your `PositionComponent`s more accurate. Say that you have a fairly
round rock as a `SpriteComponent` for example, then you don't want to register input that is in the
corner of the image where the rock is not displayed, since an image is always rectangular. Then you
can use the `Hitbox` mixin to define a more accurate polygon (or another shape) for which the input
should be within for the event to be registered on your component.

You can add new shapes to the `Hitbox` just like they are added in the below `Collidable` example.

### Collidable
The `Collidable` mixin is added to a `PositionComponent` that has a `HitBox` and it is used for
detecting collisions with other `Collidable`s. To make your component collidable you would start off
like this:

```dart
class MyCollidable extends PositionComponent with Hitbox, Collidable {
  MyCollidable (
    // This could also be done in onLoad instead of in the constructor
    final shape = HitboxPolygon([
      Vector2(0, 1),
      Vector2(1, 0),
      Vector2(0, -1),
      Vector2(-1, 0),
    ]);
    addShape(shape);
  }
}
```

The `HitboxPolygon` added to the `Collidable` here is a diamond shape(â—‡).
More about how the different shapes are defined in the [Shapes](#Shapes) section.

Remember that you can add as many `HitboxShape`s as you want to your `Collidable` to make up more
complex hitboxes. For example a snowman with a hat could be represented by three `HitboxCircle`s and
a `HitboxPolygon` as its hat.

To react to a collision you should override the `collisionCallback` in your component.
Example:

```dart
class MyCollidable extends PositionComponent with Hitbox, Collidable {
  ...

  @override
  void collisionCallback(Set<Vector2> points, Collidable other) {
    if (other is CollidableScreen) {
      ...
    } else if (other is YourOtherCollidable) {
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

In this example it can be seen how the Dart `is` keyword is used to check which other `Collidable`
that your component collided with. The set of points is where the hitboxes of the collidables
intersected. If you want to check collisions with the screen edges you can use the predefined
[ScreenCollidable](#ScreenCollidable) class.

### HasCollidables
If you want to use this collision detection in your game you have to add the `HasCollidables` mixin
to your game so that the game knows that it should keep track of which components that can collide.

Example:
```dart
class MyGame extends BaseGame with HasCollidables {
  ...
}
```

Now when you add your `Collidable` components to your game they will automatically be checked for
collisions.

### ScreenCollidable
`ScreenCollidable` is not a mixin, but a pre-made collidable component which represents the edges of
your game/screen. If you add a `ScreenCollidable` to your game your other collidables will be
notified when they collide with the edges. It doesn't take any arguments, it only depends on the
`size` of the game that it is added to. To add it you can just do `add(ScreenCollidable())` in
your game if you don't want the `ScreenCollidable` itself to be notified when something collides
with it, then you need to extend it and implement the `collisionCallback` for it.

## Shapes
### Shape
A Shape is the base class for representing a scalable geometrical shape. There are currently three
shapes:

#### Polygon
It should be noted that if you want to use collision detection or `containsPoint` on the `Polygon`,
the polygon needs to be convex. So always use convex polygons or you will most likely run into
problems if you don't really know what you are doing. It should also be noted that you should always
define the vertices in your polygon in a clockwise order.

There are two ways to create a `Polygon`, either use the normal constructor where the only mandatory
argument is a list of `Vector2` which defines how your polygon should look, but now the size or
position of it. For example you could create a diamond like in the [Collidable](#Collidable) example
like this:

```dart
Polygon([
  Vector2(0, 1),  // Middle of top wall
  Vector2(1, 0),  // Middle of right wall
  Vector2(0, -1), // Middle of bottom wall
  Vector2(-1, 0), // Middle of left wall
]);
```

The vectors in the example defines percentages of the length from the center to the edge of the
screen in both x and y axis, so for our first item in our list (`Vector2(0, 1)`) we are pointing on
on the middle of the top wall of the bounding box, since the cordinate system here is defined from
the center of the polygon.

![An example of how to define a polygon shape](images/polygon_shape.png)

In the image you can see how the polygon shape formed by the purple arrows is defined by the red
arrows.

#### Rectangle (which is just a simplified Polygon)

#### Circle

### HitboxShape
A HitboxShape is a Shape defined from the center position of the component that it is attached to
and it has the same bounding size and angle as the component. A HitboxShape is also the type of
shape that you add to your Hitbox, or Collidable.
